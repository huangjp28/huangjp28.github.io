### Calculus II (fall 2019)
##### aka Advanced Mathematics C(2)

This is the subsequent course of Calculus 1, aka Advanced Mathematics C(1). This course covers the second half of calculus for business and economics students. The focus of this course is integrals, techniques of integration, and applications. As in Calculus 1, topics with trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are not covered.

#### About tutorial and homework

Each tutorial class has two sessions. The first session is given to you to solve some selected exercises from the textbook. In the second session the exercises will be explained. After each tutorial class you can write down the answers of the exercises as homework and submit it in the next class. In order to get the 10% scores from homework you need to hand in at least 10 times.

**Exercises for tutorials**

* Sep 10    
  1. Section 5.1: Exercises 1   
  2. Prove that \\[1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\]   
    Hint: observe that $1 + n = 2 + (n-1) = \dots = n+1$   
  3. Find a formula for $k + (k+1) + \dots + n$ for any integer $k$ and $n$ such that $1 \leq k \leq n-1$
