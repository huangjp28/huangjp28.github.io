#### Prerequisites and Suggestions

Knowledge of pre-university mathematics is required and will be checked on the first lecture. A graphing calculator may be useful for self-study but is not necessary for the course and is forbad in exams. Students may also use online tools such as WolframAlpha (<https://www.wolframalpha.com/>) to deepen their understanding.

#### Schedule

The course has lecture classes and tutorial classes, where in the former we focus on understanding concepts and methods, and in the latter the purpose is how to solve problems. Take-home exercises will be assigned before each tutorial and will be explained during the tutorial. Students must hand in their answers at the beginning of each tutorial class. Answers will be marked, and the best five scores will be recorded as assignments grades.
