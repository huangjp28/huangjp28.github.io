### Using R in Financial Statistics (spring 2019)

This course introduces the basic operations of the R language, with emphasis on data analysis and visualization in financial statistics. The course teaches how to explore and analyze data. Topics contains data description and visualization, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. We will use various examples to illustrate the power of R as a statistical tool. This course requires students to try the examples by themselves.
