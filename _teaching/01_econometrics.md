### Econometrics I (fall 2017)

This is the support page for **Econometrics I** (Applied Econometrics with R, fall 2017). You can find materials (such as slides and sample programs) and other information for the course.

As a preparation for this course, you need to install R and related programs in your own computer. [Here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _teaching/02_rinstall.md %}) is a brief guide of how to install them. It is expected that you have done the installation before the second lecture.
