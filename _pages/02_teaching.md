From 2019 academic year we use **gretl** (GNU Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library) in this course. Gretl is a cross-platform software package for econometric analysis. It is free and open-source. For more information see its homepage <http://gretl.sourceforge.net/>.

R is also a good choice for econometric studies and research. Students who are familiar with programming may try to use R. Here is some useful information.
