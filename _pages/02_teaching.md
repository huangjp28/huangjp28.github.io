## Software

* ### gretl   
  From 2019 academic year I recommend using **gretl** (GNU Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library) in exercises with sample data. Gretl is a cross-platform software package for econometric analysis. It is free and open-source, so it can be an alternative to Stata, at least for classroom uses. For more information see the [[official website]](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/). The following documents provides a quick walkthrough for absolute beginners.   
  - [A beginner's guide to gretl]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/gretlintro.pdf %})
  - [gretl 初次使用指南]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/gretlintro_C.pdf %})

* ### R   
  R is also a good choice for econometric studies and research. Students who are familiar with programming may try to use R. Here are some useful websites.   
  - [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) (an empirical companion to Stock & Watson (2015) by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer)   
  - [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/)   
  - [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
