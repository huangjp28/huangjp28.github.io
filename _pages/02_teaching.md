(previously taught in spring 2021 under the same title, and fall 2016-2019 as Econometrics I)

If you are a beginner in econometrics, you can find information and materials from the page for the spring semester of 2021 [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _teaching/010_econometrics_2021.md %}), which is based on Stock & Watson (2012), to help yourself get a glimpse of the subject.

From 2019 academic year we use **gretl** (GNU Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library) in this course. Gretl is a cross-platform software package for econometric analysis. It is free and open-source. For more information see its homepage <http://gretl.sourceforge.net/>. The following document provides a quick walkthrough for absolute beginners.

* [A beginner's guide to gretl]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/gretlintro.pdf %})
* [gretl 初次使用指南]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/pdf/gretlintro_C.pdf %})

R is also a good choice for econometric studies and research. Students who are familiar with programming may try to use R. Here is some useful information.   
* [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/) (an empirical companion to Stock & Watson (2015) by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber and Martin Schmelzer)
* [A cheat sheet for basic commands in R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf)
* [A cheat sheet for RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf)
